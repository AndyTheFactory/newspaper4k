# Change Log

## 0.9.3 (2024-03-18)
Massive improvements in multi-language capabilities. Added over 40 new languages and completely reworked the language module. Much easier to add new languages now. Additionally, added support for Google News as a source. You can now search and parse news based on keywords, topic, location or website.
Itegrated cloudscraper as an optional dependency. If installed, it will us cloudscraper as a layer over requests. Cloudscraper tries to bypass cloudflair protection.
We now have use two evaluation datasets - the one from scrapinghub and one created by us drom the top 200 most popular websites. This will help keeping track of future improvements and to have a clear view of the impact of the changes.

We see a steady improvement from version 0.9.0 up to 0.9.3. The evaluation results are available in the documentation. The evaluation dataset is also available in the following repository: [Article Extraction Dataset](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/article-extraction-dataset)

## 0.9.2 (2024-01-14)
Some major changes in document parsing. In previous versions the chance that parts of the article body were missing was high. In addition, in some cases the order of the paragraphs was not correct. This release should fix these issues.

Highlighted features:
- You can now us the module as a command line interface (CLI). Usage: `python -m newspaper --url https://www.test.com`. More information in the [documentation](https://newspaper4k.readthedocs.io/).
- I have added an evaluation script against a dataset from [scrapinghub](https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark/). This will help keeping track of future improvements.
- Better handling of multithreaded requests. The previous version had a bug that could lead to a deadlock. I implemented ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module, which is more stable. The previously `news_pool` was replaced with a `fetch_news()` function.
- Caching is now much more flexible. You can disable it completely or for one request.
- You can now use `newspaper.article()` function for convenience. It will create, download and parse an article in one step. It takes all the parameters of the `Article` class.
- protected sites by cloudflare are better detected and raise an exception. The reason will be in the exception message.
