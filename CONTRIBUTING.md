## Adding languages
Interested in adding a new language for us? Refer to: ~~[Docs - Adding new
languages](https://newspaper4k.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/advanced.html#adding-new-languages)~~

At the moment we are not integrating new languages, the language api will change.
You can still submit a PR with the language you want to add and we will merge it once the language api is stable.
