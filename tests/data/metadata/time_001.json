    "summary": "James Hansen first warned Congress of the threat from climate change in 1988.\nClimate scientists have been underestimating how sensitive the global climate system will be to increased carbon dioxide emissions, according to the new paper.\nSulfur dioxide emissions, in the form of aerosols in the atmosphere, have the effect of reflecting sunlight, but they are also hazardous to human health.\nIn recent years, regulations around the world have caused sulfur dioxide emissions to fall.\nEmissions cuts alone will not be enough to ensure a safe climate in future years, according to Hansen and his collaborators.",
