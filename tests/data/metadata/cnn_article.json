The storm caused some complications and inconveniences, but no major delays or breakdowns.\n\nForecasters see mostly smooth sailing into Thanksgiving.\n\nCNN meteorologist Todd Borek predicted some lake-effect snowfall over the Great Lakes and fresh snow from a weak disturbance for the Upper Midwest.\n\nBut, he added: \"The worst in terms of widespread snow and rain is over.

It looks very good,\" he said about the possibility of balloons in the air.\n\nBut there is ample reason to support the caution.\n\nIn 1997, a woman spent more than three weeks in a coma after the Cat in the Hat balloon -- tossed by heavy winds -- struck a pole that hit her. In 2005, two other people were hurt in a similar incident involving the M&Ms balloon.\n\nOfficials say that improved weather monitoring devices en route and a police sergeant assigned to each balloon will minimize any danger.\n\n\"We came all the way from Puerto Rico to see the parade, so it will be a disappointment if we don't see the balloons,\" said Jose Ramirez, who was in New York with his family.\n\nEither way, the parade -- with or without the balloons -- will go on, organizers say.\n\nPlanes, trains ...\n\nDelays were reported at several airports in the Northeast on Wednesday.\n\nDon't get trapped by bad Thanksgiving weather: Top tips\n\nHeavy winds at all three New York-area airports -- LaGuardia, John F.
