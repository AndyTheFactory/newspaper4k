    "summary": "He passed the surveillance camera trained on his front door and the group of Israeli soldiers stationed on the hill above and walked eight minutes to the checkpoint at the end of his street.\nAzza lives in Tel Rumeida, Hebron, the most tightly controlled neighborhood in the West Bank.\nAround 35,000 Palestinians and 850 Israeli settlers live in this area, where Israeli soldiers impose a system of segregation that heavily restricts the movement of Palestinians.\nThe West Bank has long been seen as a testing ground for Israeli surveillance technology and tactics.\nSince then, a growing sense of paranoia has given Israel’s government the impetus to ramp up restrictions and surveillance in the West Bank, according to analysts and activists working in the region.",
    "meta_description": "The West Bank was Israel’s surveillance laboratory. Since the Israel-Hamas war began, Palestinian residents have been locked in for days at a time.",
