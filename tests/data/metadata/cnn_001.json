    "summary": "CNN — Justice Samuel Alito is the tip of the spear for conservatives challenging the Biden administration during oral arguments at the Supreme Court.\n“I think our best example historically is the Customs Service,” Prelogar responded.\nFrom the bench, Roberts is a tough questioner of Prelogar and Biden administration policy, but without the palpable antagonism that often comes from Alito.\nThe Biden administration was backing admissions practices that considered students’ race as a factor in admissions to achieve campus diversity.\n“No, Justice Alito,” Prelogar said.",
