But being friendly doesn’t make you friends,” Gates said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nGates’ comments come after he and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice both recommended Tillerson for the job.

But I can guarantee you, we weren’t friends. We were adversaries,” Gates said.\n\n“But in the course of doing business, you at least maintain the pleasantries. You can’t be at each other’s throats 24/7,” Gates said. “So I think mistaking a picture of somebody lifting a champagne glass or shaking hands with somebody, confusing that with being friends or being closely associated other than in a business sense, I think is a mistake. I think it’s a false narrative.”",
